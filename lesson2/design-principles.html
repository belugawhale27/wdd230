        <h3>Hick's Law</h3> 
            <h4>Zillow</h4>
                <a href="http://zillow.com">zillow.com</a>
                    <picture>

                    </picture>
                <p>Hick's Law embodies the idea of simplicity in choices. Zillow exemplifies this principle by giving the user the opportunity to input an address with a search bar or the ability to click on one of three options for what the site helps its users do: buy, sell, or rent a home. Although there are other drop down menus viewed on this homepage, these few options allow a user at a glance to get started on their search regarding their current or future home.</p>

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <h4>Google</h4>
                <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>
                    <picture>
                        <img src="images/google.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Google.com" width=325>
                    </picture>
                <p>Using white space and a clean design well is visible on Google's homepage. Google is able to keep a clean design especially in a mobile view while also using an eye-pleasing amount of white space to allow the user to easily and effectively utilize Google's search engine capacities.</p>

    <div id ="item-3">
        <h3>PARC: Repetition</h3>
            <h4>McDonald's</h4>
                <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html">mcdonalds.com</a>
                    <picture>
                        <img src="images/mcdonalds.jpg" alt="A screenshot of McDonald's.com" width=325>
                    </picture>
                <p>By using repetion in its webpage design, McDonald's is able to show consistency. McDonald's is able to exemplify the use of this principle in color choice for the button, similar images being displayed, as well as the layout's repetition with an image, a bold title, a brief description, followed by a button.</p>
